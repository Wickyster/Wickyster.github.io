	<b>Pizza Threshold </b>

<p>(Note: This text is based upon a very brief research because I hate reading about food since it makes me hungry.)</p>

<p>When does pizza stops being pizza?</p>


<p>The definition of a pizza by Merriam-Webster Dictionary:
A dish made typically of flattened bread dough spread with a savory mixture usually including tomatoes and cheese and often other toppings and baked.</p>

<p>The definitions of the word pizza are inconstant in the other dictionaries. This one seems most accurate (also Merriam-Webster Dictionary is mostly the most accurate from the dictionaries by my experience) and most workable with. So we will stick to this one.
The etymology is eventually deriving into the word bīzan - to bite of Germanic origin. We get to that back shortly.</p>

<p>There is however one thing that is missing in this definition - Italy.
To go away from definition for a second, there is this some sort of historic "origin" of pizza being flatbread with toppings popular in ancient Egypt, Greeks and Romans.<a href="#footnote-1">¹</a> Whatever these flatbreads with toppings might have been I am not considering them pizzas, this is historians of these times considering them pizzas retrospectively. We need to search for the origin of the word pizza, the very first proof of something being called pizza. And as it has been stated, the word is not Egypt, Greek or Romanian origin but it is of Germanic origin. We are of course falling again in etymology which, is in this instance, just a science of assumption. </p>

<p>The very first recorded use of the word pizza is in a Latin text from the southern Italian town of Gaeta in 997 AD, which claims that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta 'duodecim pizze', "twelve pizzas", every Christmas day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.[^2]Despite this proving that eating pizza on Christmas eve is not as depressing as it may sound, we get the very first mention of the word - in Italy.</p>

<p>How come it has Germanic origin if it's first recorded use was in Italy? Simple - in the second half of the first millennium AD (500 - 1000 AD) the Italy was subject to domination of Germanic-speaking people - Goths and Langobards.[^2]
Checks out.</p>

<p>Anyway I am not saying here that pizza has to be italian, it is just an italian dish.</p>

<p>So recap: Pizza is an italian dish flattened bread dough spread with savory mixture usually including tomatoes and cheese and often other toppings baked.
The word "usually" and "often" is, as usual, hardly often useful so we getting rid off it.
Therefore the definiton of pizza:
Pizza is an italian dish of flattened bread dough spread with savory mixture, baked.</p>

<p>This doesn't tell much but we can now atleast stay in Italy. The very first recorded use is sadly not a recipe and the very first recipe got twisted by the italian and american chefs by turning them into legends and to honor their ancestors therefore the information is not really traceable - atleast not by me that is. We need to move thousand years into the future to find some stable point from where to go.</p>

<p>I came across a man named Pellegrino Artusi. In the 1891 he published a book "La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di magiar bene" which translates to "Deep dive into the Knuckles flatulence porn". [^3] There is a pizza recipe called "pizza alla napoletana" which is Neapolitan pizza. However, this guy also has another recipes of pizza - one of them I found is "PIZZA A LIBERTII" (also known as Accordion cake) which is basically some strange dish that is not even close to pizza so far and it was added to his cookbook because some woman wrote him letter to do so[^4]. So why am I talking about such unrelatable source?</p>

<p>Well, the European Union in the year 2010 recognized Neapolitan Pizza as traditionally protected. [^5] It is very specific recipe. And when I say specific I mean autistic type specific, including percentage of dry gluten in the flour and pH of the pizza dough.
There are basically three recipes with different toppings:</p>
<ol>
 <li>tomatoes, salt, oregano, garlic and extra virgin oil</li>
 <li>tomatoes, salt, Mozzarella di Bufala Campana AOP[^6], basil and extra virgin oil</li>
 <li>tomatoes, salt, Mozzarella STG[^7], basil and extra virgin oil</li>
</ol>

<p>So I guess these three types of are the minimum to be considered pizza. For the simplicity we could ditch the Mozzarelas being under AOP and STG as well as specifics of the pizza bread. 
We could of course argue forever about this subject but this might be the closest agreement to ever been done on this matter. Otherwise we would get into shit like lasagne and magic circles being pizzas as proposed by several "funny" Pizza Alignment Charts.</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>
Therefore the definite definition[^8] of a pizza:
Pizza [pittsa]
Pizza is a  baked italian dish of flattened bread dough with savory mixture minimally consisting of tomatoes, salt, oregano, garlic and extra virgin oil; or tomatoes, salt, Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, basil and extra virgin oil; or tomatoes, salt, Mozarella, basil and extra virgin oil.
  </blockquote>

<p>Originally this was supposed to be a question of what is the minimum requirement of pizza being pizza. But if you have some consideration of what you can put on pizza or how much of toppings can you have on pizza and so on - As long as the pizza is considered pizza by the standards set in the definition, you can add anything you like, as much as you like. You can have a pizza with pineapple or pizza with chocolate. You can deepfry the pizza. Place pizza into a cake. Wrap it into tortilla. You can eat pizza with sawdust or with babies of elephants. You can have a pizza with pizza. You can eat pizza with Giohrl.</p>

 <p>Anyway, with this knowledge you now gained please do not use it as a real life argument of what is considered as an actual pizza because it is always annoying no matter what.</p>
