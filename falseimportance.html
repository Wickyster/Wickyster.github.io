	<b>False Importance </b>
This is not a text about Elite Projection (however it might be related to this) but I noticed that there is some sort of strange idea of authority or importance among people. It is mainly shown with rich people for one reason or other. Mostly because they have authoritative job telling people what to do, who kiss their asses and are forbidden to tell them no.

This false importance stems probably from the importance they have as an authority in a certain area which in reality, unknown to them, is very small.

I will start with example:
Let's say some theatre is organizing a modelling show. There is parking lot with parking staff who have simple instructions such as to send cars here and here, don't do this and that, when parking is full send the cars away and so on. After one or two hours the parking lot gets full as expected. Parking staff is sending people elsewhere since there is nowhere to park. 
But here comes this woman. Real high class bitch wearing shit worth of the entire parking staff weekly payment. She starts to tell the parking staff at the gates that she is a one of the judges an that she NEEDS to be there and that she is very important and similar shit, treating the staff like they work for her or are lower in the working class.

This is the false importance right here. The woman is confused as fuck.
As much as this woman might be important as a judge to the modelling show (or also in her job or somewhere else) she means nothing to the parking lot staff. Nothing.

This is one thing such person can't even comprehend. They can't comprehend they are not important for someone with such wage-like job for example. I mean it literally - they can't understand it, their mind is literally incapable of such concept. It's actually very interesting and funny or sad at the same time.

Back to this parking staff people and this woman with false importance. The parking lot is full, there might be some space for handicap people but that's about it - the parking lot is full. This woman needs to be here and she is told no. She gets mad as fuck. The only person who is important for them is their boss - who is probably just some parking lot in-charge and might not be even part of the theatre. The boss is not there and they have simple instructions that do not consider individuals. The parking lot is full it can't be emptied. The woman can't comprehend it. Maybe when she somehow contacts their boss then she becomes important for them, but until that happens they can't give less shit. She is some random person to them with a bitchy attitude.

This is of course one example, there are many like this and not unusual at all. Just go to the fast food place and wait for a while. You will see someone trying to be important for the cashier who takes orders maximally from manager (by the way the manager needs to have some established authority/leadership as well, otherwise he is not important either and his commands will not be fulfilled if not waved off entirely). "Customer is always right" my ass. Customer should never be right because they don't usually even know what they want - but that's for another text. Nobody who is under such a rule of "Customer is always right" is not payed enough at all to go by this rule. 

I am not saying authority or leadership is not important. It is actually quite opposite. It is very important in terms of organizing and teamwork to have someone who can lead people and so on. But some people are confused that this doesn't apply out of these places where it does applies.

So the definition of false importance is very simple really - a person who is very important for people who are positioned lower in his area, thinks he is important for the same people in lower positions everywhere.
